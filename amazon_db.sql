Powered by Android 4.2.2 and a super-fast 2.26 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, the 4G LTE-enabled LG G2 allows you to run multiple apps at once, browse the Web, or enjoy video and games seamlessly. And the 5.2-inch Full HD display is the largest display designed for one-handed operation.</p> <p>The LG G2 offers a unique, forward-thinking design that''s actually a bit backwards by placing all the buttons on the rear of the device (instead of along the sides). Moving the main buttons to the back of the phone gives you more control since this is where your index fingers are naturally located -- you''ll wonder why they haven''t always been there. Researchers have also found that moving the buttons also results in fewer dropped phones when adjusting the volume while talking.</p> <p>Capture sharp pictures and smooth videos with the G2''s 13-megapixel rear camera, which features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) technology and Full HD 1080p video recording. The LG G2 comes with 32 GB of internal storage (22 GB of user available storage) and up to 18.2 hours of talk time.</p> <h4>Edge-to-Edge Display</h4> <p>Enjoy an immersive viewing experience that fits perfectly in your hand with G2''s 5.2-inch Full HD in-plane switching (IPS) display. Its sharp, 423 pixels-per-inch resolution shows off every detail, while its IPS display gives you bright whites and rich colors with a 16:9 cinema-like presentation. In addition to the expansive viewing experience, LG''s innovative Dual Routing technology reduced the phone''s bezel to a mere 2.65mm on the side edge. For more efficient energy usage, the LG G2 employs Graphic RAM (GRAM) technology, which reduces the displays energy use by up to 26 percent on a still frame and increases overall usage time on the device by approximately 10 percent.</p> <h4>Go Further Between Charges</h4> <p>The G2''s step design 3,000 mAh battery gives you impressive power, without compromising style. With SiO+ technology (an enhanced version of the lithium-ion batteries), the G2''s battery provides maximum storage capacity and long-lasting efficiency, with a thinner profile than traditional batteries. You''ll get up to 18.2 of talk time and up to 275 hours (11.4 days) of standby time).</p> <h4>13-Megapixel Camera with Optical Image Stabilization</h4> <p>Capturing important moments in shaky conditions is a breeze with the rear camera''s Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which maintains focus while you hold the camera for less blur in photos and less shaking in videos --even in low-light settings. The Multi-Point Autofocus improves focus and depth of field with 9 AF points, especially for images with multiple faces or moving objects, while the Super Resolution Zoom provides more detail and sharper zoom quality, helping maintain clarity with 8 times the normal digital zoom. With the Dual Recording/Dual Camera feature, you can activate the front and rear cameras simultaneously to put both you and your subject in the shot with picture-in-picture technology.</p> <p>The 13-megapixel rear camera also captures video in Full HD 1080p resolution. The Audio Zoom feature helps to focus in on what you want to hear by using multiple stereo mics to amplify sound from a specified angle and de-emphasizing the surrounding noise for video recording and playback. The rear camera is complemented by a 2-megapixel front camera for video chats on the go.</p> </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-sm.gif" alt="verizon logo" height="80" width="210"> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>LG G2</h4><h5>Spec Highlights</h5> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>2.26 GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor<br><br></li> <li>5.2-inch touchscreen IPS display (1080 x 1920) <br><br></li> <li>13-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) + Optical Image Stabilization<br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera<br><br></li> <li>32 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0+ NFC<br><br></li> <li>GPS for navigation and location services<br><br></li> <li>Up to 18.2 hours of usage time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00EZW9UXW-lg-g2-verizon-rear-sm.jpg" alt="lg-g2-verizon rear" height="480" width="300"><div class="imageCaption">Designed with the power and volume buttons on the back of the phone.</div> </div> <h4>Studio Quality Hi-Fi Sound</h4> <p>The powerful Snapdragon 800 processor also helps the G2 to boast impressive sound features such as Hi-Fi sound playback and HD multichannel audio for enhanced sound quality.

Powered by Android 4.2.2 and a super-fast 2.26 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, the 4G LTE-enabled LG G2 allows you to run multiple apps at once, browse the Web, or enjoy video and games seamlessly. And the 5.2-inch Full HD display is the largest display designed for one-handed operation.</p> <p>The LG G2 offers a unique, forward-thinking design that''s actually a bit backwards by placing all the buttons on the rear of the device (instead of along the sides). Moving the main buttons to the back of the phone gives you more control since this is where your index fingers are naturally located -- you''ll wonder why they haven''t always been there. Researchers have also found that moving the buttons also results in fewer dropped phones when adjusting the volume while talking.</p> <p>Capture sharp pictures and smooth videos with the G2''s 13-megapixel rear camera, which features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) technology and Full HD 1080p video recording. The LG G2 comes with 32 GB of internal storage (22 GB of user available storage) and up to 17.9 hours of talk time.</p> <h4>Edge-to-Edge Display</h4> <p>Enjoy an immersive viewing experience that fits perfectly in your hand with G2''s 5.2-inch Full HD in-plane switching (IPS) display. Its sharp, 423 pixels-per-inch resolution shows off every detail, while its IPS display gives you bright whites and rich colors with a 16:9 cinema-like presentation. In addition to the expansive viewing experience, LG''s innovative Dual Routing technology reduced the phone''s bezel to a mere 2.65mm on the side edge. For more efficient energy usage, the LG G2 employs Graphic RAM (GRAM) technology, which reduces the display&#x2019;s energy use by up to 26 percent on a still frame and increases overall usage time on the device by approximately 10 percent.</p> <h4>Go Further Between Charges</h4> <p>The G2''s step design 3,000 mAh battery gives you impressive power, without compromising style. With SiO+ technology (an enhanced version of the lithium-ion batteries), the G2''s battery provides maximum storage capacity and long-lasting efficiency, with a thinner profile than traditional batteries. You''ll get up to 17.9 of talk time and up to 696 hours (29 days) of standby time).</p> <h4>13-Megapixel Camera with Optical Image Stabilization</h4> <p>Capturing important moments in shaky conditions is a breeze with the rear camera''s Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which maintains focus while you hold the camera for less blur in photos and less shaking in videos --even in low-light settings. The Multi-Point Autofocus improves focus and depth of field with 9 AF points, especially for images with multiple faces or moving objects, while the Super Resolution Zoom provides more detail and sharper zoom quality, helping maintain clarity with 8 times the normal digital zoom. With the Dual Recording/Dual Camera feature, you can activate the front and rear cameras simultaneously to put both you and your subject in the shot with picture-in-picture technology.</p> <p>The 13-megapixel rear camera also captures video in Full HD 1080p resolution. The Audio Zoom feature helps to focus in on what you want to hear by using multiple stereo mics to amplify sound from a specified angle and de-emphasizing the surrounding noise for video recording and playback. The rear camera is complemented by a 2-megapixel front camera for video chats on the go.</p> </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail-page/amwi-13q1-logo-att.jpg" width="210" height="100" alt="att logo" /> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>Spec Highlights</h4> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>2.26 GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor<br><br></li> <li>5.2-inch touchscreen IPS display (1080 x 1920) <br><br></li> <li>13-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) + Optical Image Stabilization<br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera<br><br></li> <li>32 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0+ NFC<br><br></li> <li>GPS for navigation and location services<br><br></li> <li>Up to 17.9 hours of usage time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00F2SGBXK-lg-g2-att-rear-sm._V356862532_.jpg" width="300" height="480" alt="lg-g2-verizon rear" /><div class="imageCaption">Designed with the power and volume buttons on the back of the phone.</div> </div> </div> <h4>Studio Quality Hi-Fi Sound</h4> <p>The powerful Snapdragon 800 processor also helps the G2 to boast impressive sound features such as Hi-Fi sound playback and HD multichannel audio for enhanced sound quality.

And with On-Call Notes, jot down ideas during a call and access them later on from G2''s call log entry.</p> <p><strong>QuickRemote.</strong> Turn your G2 into a programmable remote to control multiple compatible electronic devices such as TVs, cable set-top-boxes, audio systems, and even air conditioners.</p> <p><strong>Capture Plus.</strong> Save a full Web page rather than a limited screen capture.</p> <p><strong>Clip Tray.</strong> Lets you copy and store multiple items, such as a screen shot, to a PC-like clipboard for use in other applications.</p> <p><strong>Slide Aside.</strong> Move between up to three apps at once, by using three fingers to slide your current screen aside, and access another app.</p> <p><strong>Guest Mode.</strong> Customize the G2''s experience with two modes -- one for yourself and one for a child or guest -- keeping your personal information and device settings safer. Access Guest Mode by unlocking the device with a separate lock screen pattern, letting you control which apps are available for a different user.</p> <p><strong>KnockON.</strong> A simple knocking gesture is all it takes to wake G2''s display without picking it up or pressing the power key.

AT&T expects to cover 300 million people with its 4G LTE network by the end of 2014.</p> <p>With 4G LTE technology, you''ll get mobile Internet speeds up to 10 times faster than 3G, enabling you to upload a photo in 6 seconds, download a song in 4 seconds, and download HD movies in minutes and apps almost instantly. You can expect average download data rates of 13 megabits per second (Mbps) and 6 Mbps for uploads in real-world, loaded network environments.</p> <p>If you are not in an area served by 4G LTE, you''ll be able to connect to AT&T''s HSPA+ enhanced backhaul network, which delivers speeds up to 4x faster than AT&T''s HSPA 3G network. With the combination of 4G LTE and HSPA+, you''ll enjoy higher data speed averages than other networks.</p> <p>In areas where either AT&T''s 3G or 4G network is not available, you''ll continue to receive service on the AT&T EDGE network, which offers availability in more than 13,000 US cities and along some 40,000 miles of major highways.</p> <div class="break"></div> <div class="rightImage" style="width:300px"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-feat-android-jball-goognow-sm.jpg" width="196" height="300" alt="jb all goog now" /><div class="imageCaption">Google Now.</div> </div> <h4>Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) OS</h4>  <p>Fast, fluid, and smooth, the Android 4.2 operating system (nicknamed Jelly Bean) offers effortless movement between home screens -- like turning the pages of a book.

Its powerful battery outlasts other smartphones and keeps you connected day, night, and then some. And its seamless design is reinforced with DuPont KEVLAR fiber and protected by scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass. A Verizon exclusive, the DROID MAXX keeps up with your every move, whether it''s shooting great low-light photos or sharing video quickly at 4G LTE speed.</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W8Q1A-moto-droidmaxx-veriz-main-lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W8Q1A-moto-droidmaxx-veriz-main-sm.jpg" width="300" height="348" alt="DROID MAXX" /></a><div class="imageCaption">The Motorola DROID MAXX (<a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W8Q1A-moto-droidmaxx-veriz-main-lg.jpg" target="_blank">view larger</a>).</div> </div> <p>Running the Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system, the DROID MAXX is powered by the Motorola X8 Mobile Computing System, which includes a software optimized Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro (1.7 GHz Dual-Core Krait CPU, quad-core Adreno 320 GPU), a natural language processor, and a contextual computing processor.</p> <p>Keeping up with the DROID tradition, the DROID MAXX gives you what you expect from a DROID on Verizon -- intelligence, strength and endurance. It starts with DROID Command Center, an exclusive homescreen widget that enables you to easily access notifications for text messages, missed calls, battery level, and weather. It also serves as the gateway to new features including Wireless Display to mirror what''s on the screen onto a compatible HDTV to play games, browse the Web, and share pictures on a big screen.</p> <p>The DROID MAXX has 32 GB of internal storage, and its 3500 mAh battery provides up to 48 hours of mixed use based on typical usage patterns.</p> <h4>More Pics in More Places</h4> <p>With the Quick Capture feature, you can access the 10-megapixel camera by shaking the phone twice, then tapping anywhere on the screen to snap a pic or a selfie. The embedded Clear Pixel technology collects more light and snaps pictures up to twice as fast as other phone''s cameras, so you can capture the darkest scenes or stop motion blur in bright light. The rear camera also records Full HD 1080p video and stereo sound, while the front-facing 2-megapixel camera is great for self portraits and video chats.</p> <p>The 10-megapixel rear camera has a 16:9 aspect ratio and can shoot video at up to Full HD 1080p resolution at 30 fps (frames per second) with slow motion. It also features auto HDR, a panorama option, photo burst, and a 4x digital zoom. The front-facing 2-megapixel camera is great for self portraits and video chats.</p> <h4>DROID Zap Makes Sharing Easy</h4> <p>Sharing with a friend or a group of friends nearby is simple with the DROID Zap feature. Just one gesture sends your content to the cloud, and anyone nearby with an Android phone running Jelly Bean 2.2 or greater can download the media. And if you want to limit who sees your stuff, add a pin code. Seamlessly share the latest memories with your friends and family without the need for wires -- or even physical contact.</p> <h4>Touchless Control</h4> <p>The DROID MAXX responds to your voice, without you having to touch it. You just have to say: "OK Google Now" and give it a command. You can check messages, set an alarm, get directions, find out the weather, or do just about anything. With just a little training in a quiet room, your DROID MAXX learns to recognize your voice. Then it knows you, even when everyone''s talking at once. And thanks to the super low-power natural language processor, your DROID MAXX is always ready with a quick response. </p> <h4>Active Display</h4> <p>Even when it seems to be sleeping, your DROID MAXX is paying attention. Instead of a blinking light that doesn''t actually tell you anything, information quietly appears on the screen. You don''t have to wake your phone to look at the time or see your messages. But the active display is also smart enough to know when it''s in your pocket or when it''s placed face down so it won''t deliver notifications, saving on battery power. As soon as you take it out of your pocket or turn it over, it discretely pulses with the time and any notifications you''ve received. </p> <p>When you need a little more info, just touch the notification icon and details will appear on the top and bottom of the screen. Drag the icon up and the app associated with the notification will open. Drag the icon left or right to make them all go away.</p>  </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-sm.gif" width="210" height="80" alt="verizon logo" /> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>Motorola DROID MAXX</h4><h5>Spec Highlights</h5> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>1.7 GHz dual-core processor<br><br></li> <li>5-inch touchscreen AMOLED display (720 x 1280) <br><br></li> <li>10-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) <br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera for video chats<br><br></li> <li>32 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 LE+ NFC<br><br></li> <li>GPS for navigation and location services<br><br></li> <li>Up to 48 hours of usage time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="three-fourth-col">  <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <br><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-4glte-sm.jpg" width="200" height="175" alt="veriz 4g lte" /> </div> <h4>Verizon''s 4G LTE Network</h4> <p>Covering over 90 percent of the U.S. population (287 million people across the country), the Verizon Wireless 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) network provides average download data rates of 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) and 2-5 Mbps on the uplink in real-world, loaded network environments.</p>   <p>You''ll be able to stream HD movies without the annoyance of constant pauses to buffer the video stream--as well as quickly download HD-quality movies right to your phone in minutes.

You can also show your high-resolution photos off as enlarged prints, or upload them to AT&T Locker, the exclusive cloud storage platform for uploading and storing your high-resolution images and videos captured in Nokia Pro Camera.</p>   <p>To make showing off even easier, Nokia Lumia 1020 automatically optimizes your images into friendly file sizes, ready for sharing with your friends and social networks.

And if you want to go back and reframe, you can always access the original full resolution image simply by clicking on the &#x201C;Nokia Pro Camera&#x201D; link located below the photo.</p>   <h4>AT&T Locker</h4>   <p>Need a place to save and share all of the great photos you have taken with the Nokia Lumia 1020?

It''s faster because it hears your voice and responds with Google Now. It tells you what you need to know, even when you''re not touching it. You''ll also be able to stay informed without constantly turning on your phone thanks to the new ultra-low power notification system. </p> <p>Pick it up, and the Moto X is curved to fit your hand. With a twist of your wrist, it becomes your camera. Use a simple gesture to instantly launch the 10-megapixel rear camera without unlocking the phone. An easy-to-use interface allows you to capture images faster -- just touch anywhere on the screen to snap a photo and quickly shoot a burst of photos. The comfortable Moto X features a custom shaped battery that filled the curved space and powers your Moto X through a whole day.</p> <p>Running the Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system, the Moto X is powered by the Motorola X8 Mobile Computing System, which includes a software optimized Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro (1.7 GHz Dual-Core Krait CPU, quad-core Adreno 320 GPU), a natural language processor, and a contextual computing processor.</p> <p>The Moto X has 16 GB of internal storage, and its 2200 mAh battery provides up to 13 hours of talk time and 10 days (240 hours) of standby time.</p> <h4>Never Miss a Shot</h4> <p>The Moto X allows you to go from pocket to picture in just a few seconds, so you''ll never miss a shot again. Whether your Moto X is in your pocket or already in use, just twist your wrist twice and it''s ready to shoot. And because you can touch anywhere on the screen, it only takes one hand -- and just a few seconds -- to capture a perfect shot. The embedded Clear Pixel technology collects more light and snaps pictures up to twice as fast as other phone''s cameras, so you can capture the darkest scenes or stop motion blur in bright light. </p> <p>The 10-megapixel rear camera has a 16:9 aspect ratio and can shoot video at up to Full HD 1080p resolution at 30 fps (frames per second) with slow motion. It also features auto HDR, a panorama option, photo burst, and a 4x digital zoom.</p> <h4>Touchless Control</h4> <p>The Moto X responds to your voice, without you having to touch it. You just have to say: "OK Google Now" and give it a command. You can check messages, set an alarm, get directions, find out the weather, or do just about anything. With just a little training in a quiet room, your Moto X learns to recognize your voice. Then it knows you, even when everyone''s talking at once. And thanks to the super low-power natural language processor, your Moto X is always ready with a quick response. </p> </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-sm._V383818039_.gif" width="260" height="100" alt="Verizon Wireless Logo" /> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>Motorola Moto X</h4><h5>Spec Highlights</h5> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>1.7 GHz dual-core processor + 400 MHz quad-core graphics processor<br><br></li> <li>4.7-inch touchscreen AMOLED display (720 x 1280) <br><br></li> <li>10-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) <br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera with HD 720p video<br><br></li> <li>16 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 LE + NFC<br><br></li> <li>Up to 13 hours of talk time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="three-fourth-col">  <h4>Active Display</h4> <p>Even when it seems to be sleeping, your Moto X is paying attention. Instead of a blinking light that doesn''t actually tell you anything, information quietly appears on the screen. You don''t have to wake your phone to look at the time or see your messages. But the active display is also smart enough to know when it''s in your pocket or when it''s placed face down so it won''t deliver notifications, saving on battery power. As soon as you take it out of your pocket or turn it over, it discretely pulses with the time and any notifications you''ve received. </p> <p>When you need a little more info, just touch the notification icon and details will appear on the top and bottom of the screen. Drag the icon up and the app associated with the notification will open. Drag the icon left or right to make them all go away.</p> <h4>Smart Extras</h4> <p><strong>Motorola Migrate:</strong> Wirelessly  your old phone''s stuff -- photos, videos, SIM contacts and even your call and text history -- from any Android phone in just a few steps.</p> <p><strong>Motorola Assist:</strong> Recognizes when you shouldn''t be bothered, like when you''re sleeping or driving. You can set actions and exceptions so that they work exactly how you want them to. </p> <p><strong>Motorola Connect:</strong> Read and reply to texts, and see who''s calling your Moto X directly from your computer''s Chrome browser. All without ever having to reach for your phone.</p> <p><strong>Google Drive:</strong> Moto X owners get an extra 50 GB of Google Drive storage (on top of the standard 15 GB) free for two years to safely keep and share photos, documents and other files (for a total of 65 GB).</p> <h4>What''s in the Box</h4> <p>Moto X; energy efficient charger; Micro USB cable; SIM removal tool; getting started guide</p> </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage" style="width:210px"> <br><br><a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/motorola-motox-att-white-rear-lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/motorola-motox-att-black-rear-sm.jpg" width="210" height="400" alt="moto x white rear" /></a><div class="imageCaption">10-MP rear camera activates with two twists of your wrist (<a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/motorola-motox-att-black-rear-lg.jpg" target="_blank">view larger</a>).</div> </div> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="OS" > <div class="three-fourth-col">  <h4>Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) OS</h4>  <p>Fast, fluid, and smooth, the Android 4.2 operating system (nicknamed Jelly Bean) offers effortless movement between home screens -- like turning the pages of a book.

The expansive display is also protected by Gorilla Glass 2.0 to guard against cracks and scratches and provide enhanced touchscreen responsiveness. </p> <p>The Galaxy S III runs the Android 4.0 operating system (a.k.a., Ice Cream Sandwich), bringing a redesigned user interface with enhanced multitasking, notifications, full Web browsing experience, and more. You''ll also enjoy innovative, next-gen features such as Face Unlock, which uses facial recognition to unlock the Galaxy S III, and Near Field Communications (NFC) capabilities.</p> <p>Going beyond simple point-and-shoot photography, the 8-megapixel rear camera offers a Burst Shot mode that captures still pictures at a rapid-fire pace at three images per second with zero shutter lag, and its Best Shot feature recommends the best picture to keep based on colors, lighting, and clarity. It also records Full HD 1080p video with a backside illuminated sensor that improves performance in low light environments--and you can even capture a photo while shooting video.</p> <p>Other features include Wireless-N Wi-Fi connectivity with mobile hotspot capabilities (enabling you to connect up to 10 devices to your Sprint 3G/4G mobile broadband), Bluetooth 4.0 with stereo audio streaming, 16 GB internal storage, memory expansion via optional microSD cards, and up to 9.2 hours of talk time.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Galaxy S III is able to access the Sprint 4G LTE network, available in limited markets.

And with Share Shot, you can send photos to all your party guests so everyone leaves with snapshots of the event.</p> <p><strong>Access Content on Multiple Devices:</strong> Through AllShare Play, you can share files with other devices and access those files on various devices, such as documents or multimedia files between your Galaxy S III phone and a tablet, PC, or television. With AllShare Group Cast on the Galaxy S III and a Wi-Fi network, you can share and collaborate on documents, presentations or images in real-time with multiple friends or co-workers without loading the file separately.</p>  <h2>Intelligent and Intuitive Interaction</h2> <p>Smart enough to detect your face, voice and motions, the Galaxy S III provides a more convenient and natural way for you to interact so it fits seamlessly into your daily routine.</p> <p><strong>Let Your Eyes Control the Display:</strong> Thanks to the Smart Stay feature, the screen display will remain bright as long as you''re looking at the phone. Set it down, and it dims instantly. Because the front-facing camera can identify your eyes--while reading an e-book or browsing the web, for instance--it recognizes how you are using your phone and provides a bright display accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Tell Your Phone What to Do:</strong> The S Voice feature enables the Galaxy S III to actually listen and respond to your words: tell it to wake up, snooze, take a photo, answer a call, send a text message, or play a favorite song.</p> <p><strong>Don''t Miss a Message:</strong> If you''ve been away from your phone, the Smart Alert feature will give you a vibrating nudge to let you know about missed calls and messages.</p> <h2>Vital Statistics</h2> <p>The Samsung Galaxy S III weighs 4.7 ounces and measures 5.4 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches.

And with Google+ integration, you can video chat with groups of up to 9 friends as well as easily upload and share photos and videos. Other features include:</p> <strong>Face Unlock</strong><br> <p>You can now unlock your phone with just your face using the Face Unlock option. It takes advantage of the front-facing camera and state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to register a face during setup and then to recognize it again when unlocking the device. Just hold your phone in front of your face to unlock (or use a backup PIN). </p> <p>And the lock screen now lets you do more without unlocking. From the slide lock screen, you can jump directly to the camera for a picture or pull down the notifications window to check for messages. When listening to music, you can even manage music tracks and see album art. </p> <strong>Home Screen Folders</strong><br> <p>Quickly access related apps right from the home screen by organizing apps and shortcuts into folders--just drag one app onto another to create a folder.</p> <strong>Multitasking</strong><br> <p>Multitasking is even easier and more visual in Android 4.0. The Recent Apps button lets you jump instantly from one task to another using the list in the System Bar. The list pops up to show thumbnail images of apps used recently--tapping a thumbnail switches to the app. </p> <strong>Voice Input</strong><br> <p>The new voice engine in Android 4.0 lets you dictate the text you want, for as long as you want, using the language you want. You can speak continuously for a prolonged time, even pausing for intervals if needed, and dictate punctuation to create correct sentences. As the voice input engine enters text, it underlines possible dictation errors in gray. After dictating, you can tap the underlined words to quickly replace them from a list of suggestions. </p> <h2>Near Field Communications</h2> <p>A short-range wireless technology similar to Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (or NFC) allows enabled devices to share information in close proximity. For example, you can "touch" or "swipe" an NFC tag that might be embedded in a poster, sticker, or advertisement, then act on the data read from the tag. </p> <p>You can also utilize NFC for contactless payment via Google Wallet. Instead of using cash or swiping a credit card, just touch your phone to an NFC payment reader and have your purchase deducted automatically. Store virtual versions of credit, loyalty and gift cards securely in Google Wallet, as well as coupons and offers that can be redeemed when you make a payment. You can make payments at hundreds thousands of locations nationwide where MasterCard PayPass is accepted.</p> <br><hr><br> <table cellpadding="10" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"

With this innovative camera technology, you''ll be able to quickly shoot vivid, true-to-life images with a wide range of colors, even in low light conditions -- it lets in 300 percent more light, enabling you to take photos indoors without a flash. And this is accomplished not by increasing the number of megapixels in the camera, but by engineering a more advanced CMOS Sensor, ISP, and optical lens system that captures significantly more light than most 8 or 13 megapixel cameras.</p> <p>With HTC Zoe mode, press the shutter and the HTC One automatically captures up to 20 photos and a 3-second video -- including the last second of images before you tapped the picture button. It can also create a 30-second Zoe Highlight film from each event comprised of Zoes, photos, and videos with professionally designed cuts, transitions, and effects -- just ad your choice of pre-loaded soundtrack. These highlight videos can be remixed or set to different themes, and can be easily shared on social networks, email, and other services.</p> <p>Multi-axis optical image stabilization for the rear camera also helps ensure video footage smoother whether stationary or on the move. Other features and effects include enhanced 360-degree panorama, time sequencing, and object removal. Self portraits and video are also easily captured via the front-facing camera, which supports 1080p video capture.</p> <h4>HTC BlinkFeed: A Personal Live Stream on Your Home Screen</h4> <p>At the heart of the HTC One experience is HTC BlinkFeed, which transforms your home screen into a single live stream of the things that are most important to you --from sports and technology to games and fashion and even your favorite social network feeds. It''s all customized by you, and it''s constantly updated live. </p> <p>To see more detail, just tap on any item in your HTC BlinkFeed to view text, pictures and videos, and then share it with just a couple more taps.

The new exterior is a whole new take on the Samsung Galaxy experience. The sleek magazine-style viewing option always keeps your favorite content right at your fingertips. And the S Pen is a better way to control, write, and get more done.</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/samsung-galaxynote3-angleSpen-black-sm.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="galaxynote3-angleSpen" /><div class="imageCaption">The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with refined S Pen.</div> </div> <p>But even with its advanced features, the Galaxy Note 3 is still simple to use. With features like touch-free voice control, smarter file search and a hassle-free way to transfer your existing content -- it''s a simplified experience.</p>  <p>The Galaxy Note 3 features a wider 5.7-inch Full HD 1080p Super AMOLED display, yet it''s slimmer and lighter than its predecessor (8.3mm and 5.93 ounces, respectively) and has a more powerful and longer lasting 3200 mAh battery.

It features 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded using optional microSD memory cards up to 64 GB. </p> <h4>Multi Window</h4> <p>Do more with the advanced Multi Window feature. Open two windows of the same app, so you can browse your Facebook feed while you post your vacation photos. Or you can drag and drop an address from an email into a Google Maps search without cutting and pasting, so you can get to your destination faster. (Note that Multi Window does not support all applications.)</p> <h4>My Magazine</h4> <p>Everything that matters to you is just a glance away with the magazine-inspired interface, where you can curate content tailored to the things you love. Get instant updates on your favorite sports teams or celebrities, check a live Facebook and Twitter feed, or get suggestions for the best place to grab lunch down the street.</p> <h4>S Pen </h4> <p>Interact with your phone like never before using S Pen. Handwriting input lets you jot notes, compose emails or write text messages by turning your handwriting into text. You can quickly jot down a number and then automatically add it to your contacts later with Action Memo. And if you use your S Pen a little more creatively, you can share your creation with the world on Pen.Up. </p> <h4>Galaxy Camera </h4> <p>Make memories unforgettable with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3''s 13-megapixel camera. It uses the same interface as the Samsung Galaxy S 4 and the Galaxy Camera so you can remove photo distractions with a touch using Eraser or capture every frame of the perfect cannonball with Drama Shot. </p> <h4>Scrapbook</h4> <p>Keep track of what catches your eye with Scrapbook. See artwork that would go perfectly with your newly remodeled living room? Clip it with S Pen and add it to your living room board. You can also clip and pin web pages, videos, text and more.

AT&T''s 4G LTE network is currently live in 261 markets across the U.S. (as of May, 2013) with more markets continually being added. AT&T expects to cover 300 million people with its 4G LTE network by the end of 2014.</p> <p>With 4G LTE technology, you''ll get mobile Internet speeds up to 10 times faster than 3G, enabling you to upload a photo in 6 seconds, download a song in 4 seconds, and download HD movies in minutes and apps almost instantly. You can expect average download data rates of 13 megabits per second (Mbps) and 6 Mbps for uploads in real-world, loaded network environments.</p> <p>If you are not in an area served by 4G LTE, you''ll be able to connect to AT&T''s HSPA+ enhanced backhaul network, which delivers speeds up to 4x faster than AT&T''s HSPA 3G network. With the combination of 4G LTE and HSPA+, you''ll enjoy higher data speed averages than other networks.</p> <p>In areas where either AT&T''s 3G or 4G network is not available, you''ll continue to receive service on the AT&T EDGE network, which offers availability in more than 13,000 US cities and along some 40,000 miles of major highways.</p> <div class="break"></div> <div class="OS" > <div class="three-fourth-col">  <h4>Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) OS</h4>  <p>An even sweeter Jelly Bean, the Android 4.3 operating system''s Android 4.3''s new restricted profiles feature can be used to limit access to apps and content -- at home with your family and at work.  Fast, fluid, and smooth, Android 4.3 offers effortless movement between home screens -- like turning the pages of a book.

For example, a parent can set up profiles for each family member, and a business manager can set up profiles that keep employees focused on work. </p> <p><strong>Built-in Security Protection.</strong> Android is designed to keep you and your data safe. Every app runs in its own sandbox, a secure space isolated from other apps. And whenever you download an app, Android can automatically scan it for viruses, checking apps against a database maintained by Google. </p> <p><strong>Expandable, Actionable Notifications.</strong> Android has always put you in control when it comes to staying notified and connected. Just swipe down from the top of the screen to see all your notifications in one place. Late for a meeting or missed a call?

With this innovative camera technology, you''ll be able to quickly shoot vivid, true-to-life images with a wide range of colors, even in low light conditions -- it lets in 300 percent more light, enabling you to take photos indoors without a flash. And this is accomplished not by increasing the number of megapixels in the camera, but by engineering a more advanced CMOS Sensor, ISP, and optical lens system that captures significantly more light than most 8 or 13 megapixel cameras.</p> <p>With HTC Zoe mode, press the shutter and the HTC One automatically captures up to 20 photos and a 3-second video -- including the last second of images before you tapped the picture button. It can also create a 30-second Zoe Highlight film from each event comprised of Zoes, photos, and videos with professionally designed cuts, transitions, and effects -- just ad your choice of pre-loaded soundtrack. These highlight videos can be remixed or set to different themes, and can be easily shared on social networks, email, and other services.</p> <p>Multi-axis optical image stabilization for the rear camera also helps ensure video footage smoother whether stationary or on the move. Other features and effects include enhanced 360-degree panorama, time sequencing, and object removal. Self portraits and video are also easily captured via the front-facing camera, which supports 1080p video capture.</p> <h4>HTC BlinkFeed: A Personal Live Stream on Your Home Screen</h4> <p>At the heart of the HTC One experience is HTC BlinkFeed, which transforms your home screen into a single live stream of the things that are most important to you --from sports and technology to games and fashion and even your favorite social network feeds.

Ultrathin and lightweight, DROID MINI is easy to hold and carry yet solidly built to handle life''s bumps, scrapes and spills. Its seamless design is reinforced with DuPont KEVLAR fiber and protected by scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass. A Verizon exclusive, the DROID MINI features an edge-to-edge 4.3-inch HD display and ultra-fast connectivity with Verizon''s 4G LTE network.</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W9D4E-moto-droidmini-veriz-main-lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W9D4E-moto-droidmini-veriz-main-sm.jpg" width="300" height="353" alt="DROID MINI" /></a><div class="imageCaption">The Motorola DROID MINI (<a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/B00E9W9D4E-moto-droidmini-veriz-main-lg.jpg" target="_blank">view larger</a>).</div> </div> <p>Running the Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system, the DROID MINI is powered by the Motorola X8 Mobile Computing System, which includes a software optimized Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro (1.7 GHz Dual-Core Krait CPU, quad-core Adreno 320 GPU), a natural language processor, and a contextual computing processor.</p> <p>Keeping up with the DROID tradition, the DROID MINI gives you what you expect from a DROID on Verizon -- intelligence, strength and endurance. It starts with DROID Command Center, an exclusive homescreen widget that enables you to easily access notifications for text messages, missed calls, battery level, and weather. It also serves as the gateway to new features including Wireless Display to mirror what''s on the screen onto a compatible HDTV to play games, browse the Web, and share pictures on a big screen.</p> <p>The DROID MINI has 16 GB of internal storage, and its 2000 mAh battery provides up to 28 hours of mixed use based on typical usage patterns.</p> <h4>More Pics in More Places</h4> <p>With the Quick Capture feature, you can access the 10-megapixel camera by shaking the phone twice, then tapping anywhere on the screen to snap a pic or a selfie. The embedded Clear Pixel technology collects more light and snaps pictures up to twice as fast as other phone''s cameras, so you can capture the darkest scenes or stop motion blur in bright light. The rear camera also records Full HD 1080p video and stereo sound, while the front-facing 2-megapixel camera is great for self portraits and video chats.</p> <p>The 10-megapixel rear camera has a 16:9 aspect ratio and can shoot video at up to Full HD 1080p resolution at 30 fps (frames per second) with slow motion. It also features auto HDR, a panorama option, photo burst, and a 4x digital zoom. The front-facing 2-megapixel camera is great for self portraits and video chats.</p> <h4>DROID Zap Makes Sharing Easy</h4> <p>Sharing with a friend or a group of friends nearby is simple with the DROID Zap feature. Just one gesture sends your content to the cloud, and anyone nearby with an Android phone running Jelly Bean 2.2 or greater can download the media. And if you want to limit who sees your stuff, add a pin code. Seamlessly share the latest memories with your friends and family without the need for wires -- or even physical contact.</p> <h4>Touchless Control</h4> <p>The DROID MINI responds to your voice, without you having to touch it. You just have to say: "OK Google Now" and give it a command. You can check messages, set an alarm, get directions, find out the weather, or do just about anything. With just a little training in a quiet room, your DROID MINI learns to recognize your voice. Then it knows you, even when everyone''s talking at once. And thanks to the super low-power natural language processor, your DROID MINI is always ready with a quick response. </p> <h4>Active Display</h4> <p>Even when it seems to be sleeping, your DROID MINI is paying attention. Instead of a blinking light that doesn''t actually tell you anything, information quietly appears on the screen. You don''t have to wake your phone to look at the time or see your messages. But the active display is also smart enough to know when it''s in your pocket or when it''s placed face down so it won''t deliver notifications, saving on battery power. As soon as you take it out of your pocket or turn it over, it discretely pulses with the time and any notifications you''ve received. </p> <p>When you need a little more info, just touch the notification icon and details will appear on the top and bottom of the screen. Drag the icon up and the app associated with the notification will open. Drag the icon left or right to make them all go away.</p>  </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-sm.gif" width="210" height="80" alt="verizon logo" /> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>Motorola DROID MINI</h4><h5>Spec Highlights</h5> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>1.7 GHz dual-core processor<br><br></li> <li>4.3-inch touchscreen AMOLED display (720 x 1280) <br><br></li> <li>10-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) <br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera for video chats<br><br></li> <li>16 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 LE+ NFC<br><br></li> <li>GPS for navigation and location services<br><br></li> <li>Up to 28 hours of usage time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="three-fourth-col">  <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <br><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/amwi-13q2-logo-verizon-4glte-sm.jpg" width="200" height="175" alt="veriz 4g lte" /> </div> <h4>Verizon''s 4G LTE Network</h4> <p>Covering over 90 percent of the U.S. population (287 million people across the country), the Verizon Wireless 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) network provides average download data rates of 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) and 2-5 Mbps on the uplink in real-world, loaded network environments.</p>   <p>You''ll be able to stream HD movies without the annoyance of constant pauses to buffer the video stream--as well as quickly download HD-quality movies right to your phone in minutes.

Powered by Android 4.2.2 and a super-fast 2.26 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, the 4G LTE-enabled LG G2 allows you to run multiple apps at once, browse the Web, or enjoy video and games seamlessly. And the 5.2-inch Full HD display is the largest display designed for one-handed operation.</p> <p>The LG G2 offers a unique, forward-thinking design that''s actually a bit backwards by placing all the buttons on the rear of the device (instead of along the sides). Moving the main buttons to the back of the phone gives you more control since this is where your index fingers are naturally located -- you''ll wonder why they haven''t always been there. Researchers have also found that moving the buttons also results in fewer dropped phones when adjusting the volume while talking.</p> <p>Capture sharp pictures and smooth videos with the G2''s 13-megapixel rear camera, which features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) technology and Full HD 1080p video recording. The LG G2 comes with 32 GB of internal storage (22 GB of user available storage) and up to 17.9 hours of talk time.</p> <h4>Edge-to-Edge Display</h4> <p>Enjoy an immersive viewing experience that fits perfectly in your hand with G2''s 5.2-inch Full HD in-plane switching (IPS) display. Its sharp, 423 pixels-per-inch resolution shows off every detail, while its IPS display gives you bright whites and rich colors with a 16:9 cinema-like presentation. In addition to the expansive viewing experience, LG''s innovative Dual Routing technology reduced the phone''s bezel to a mere 2.65mm on the side edge. For more efficient energy usage, the LG G2 employs Graphic RAM (GRAM) technology, which reduces the display&#x2019;s energy use by up to 26 percent on a still frame and increases overall usage time on the device by approximately 10 percent.</p> <h4>Go Further Between Charges</h4> <p>The G2''s step design 3,000 mAh battery gives you impressive power, without compromising style. With SiO+ technology (an enhanced version of the lithium-ion batteries), the G2''s battery provides maximum storage capacity and long-lasting efficiency, with a thinner profile than traditional batteries. You''ll get up to 17.9 of talk time and up to 696 hours (29 days) of standby time).</p> <h4>13-Megapixel Camera with Optical Image Stabilization</h4> <p>Capturing important moments in shaky conditions is a breeze with the rear camera''s Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which maintains focus while you hold the camera for less blur in photos and less shaking in videos --even in low-light settings. The Multi-Point Autofocus improves focus and depth of field with 9 AF points, especially for images with multiple faces or moving objects, while the Super Resolution Zoom provides more detail and sharper zoom quality, helping maintain clarity with 8 times the normal digital zoom. With the Dual Recording/Dual Camera feature, you can activate the front and rear cameras simultaneously to put both you and your subject in the shot with picture-in-picture technology.</p> <p>The 13-megapixel rear camera also captures video in Full HD 1080p resolution. The Audio Zoom feature helps to focus in on what you want to hear by using multiple stereo mics to amplify sound from a specified angle and de-emphasizing the surrounding noise for video recording and playback. The rear camera is complemented by a 2-megapixel front camera for video chats on the go.</p> </div> <div class="fourth-col last">  <div class="leftImage"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/logos/sprintt-nav-logo-250x120._V357119417_.jpg" width="250" height="120" alt="Sprint Logo" /> </div> <div class="break"></div> <h4>Spec Highlights</h4> <ul> <li>3G/4G LTE connectivity<br><br></li> <li>Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system<br><br></li> <li>2.26 GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor<br><br></li> <li>5.2-inch touchscreen IPS display (1080 x 1920) <br><br></li> <li>13-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) + Optical Image Stabilization<br><br></li> <li>Front 2-MP camera<br><br></li> <li>32 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM<br><br></li> <li>Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0+ NFC<br><br></li> <li>GPS for navigation and location services<br><br></li> <li>Up to 17.9 hours of usage time<br><br></li> </ul> </div> <div class="break"></div> <div class="leftImage" style="width:300px"> <img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail/lg-g2-back._V353334323_.jpg" width="300" height="560" alt="lg-g2-verizon rear" /><div class="imageCaption">Designed with the power and volume buttons on the back of the phone.</div> </div> </div> <h4>Studio Quality Hi-Fi Sound</h4> <p>The powerful Snapdragon 800 processor also helps the G2 to boast impressive sound features such as Hi-Fi sound playback and HD multichannel audio for enhanced sound quality.
